 AI-Based System for Tracking and Monitoring Kidney Disease Progression Using Medical Imaging
Project abstract:Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has become a major global health concern, often progressing silently until reaching advanced stages. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual interpretation of medical images and clinical data. This project proposes an AI-Based System for Tracking and Monitoring Kidney Disease Progression Using Medical Imaging, designed to assist clinicians in identifying disease stages and changes over time with high accuracy.
The system leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to automatically analyze kidney ultrasound, CT, or MRI images, extract critical biomarkers such as kidney size, texture irregularities, and cystic formations, and detect early signs of nephropathy. A trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model evaluates disease severity and progression trends, while an interactive dashboard visualizes patient data for easy interpretation.
By integrating AI-driven image analysis with longitudinal patient tracking, this system aims to enable faster diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and real-time progression monitoring. Ultimately, it enhances clinical decision-making and supports proactive kidney health management through an accessible, intelligent, and automated framework.
